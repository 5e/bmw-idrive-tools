tools to update your iDrive service history
* BMW Service History Manager Lite by BlackBoxSys (original link: https://automotive.blackboxsys.com/dld/SHMLite.exe)
* HU Service Manager by BMWTOOLS.INFO

This repo was made just for myself to keep the links handy

IF YOU'RE USING THIS PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH IF THE TOOL(S) ARE COMPATIBLE FOR YOUR CAR AND HOW TO USE THEM

Remember, these tools will only update the service history in your car, they will not be uploaded to the online BMW dealer database. They will be deleted if the car gets serviced at a main dealer.
